# JER From QCD datasets

Coffea implementation of finding JER using QCD datasets


## Description

This repository is intended to be run on [coffea.casa](coffea.casa).

There are two main Jupyter Notebook files in the repository.  

* Main coffea-processor is in the [qcd-processor](https://github.com/mandalaritra1/JERcoffeacasa/blob/master/qcd_processor-v3.ipynb) file. This is where the histograms are defined and created. 
* [plotting.ipynb](https://github.com/mandalaritra1/JERcoffeacasa/blob/master/plotting.ipynb) - scipy and matplotlib based fitting and plotting is done in this notebook

Some helpful function and the main fitting class is in the `utils.py` file.
