## Description

This repository is intended to be run on [coffea.casa](coffea.casa).

There are two main Jupyter Notebook files in the repository.  

* [Main coffea-processor is in the qcd-processor file. This is where the histograms are defined and created. ](https://github.com/mandalaritra1/JERcoffeacasa/blob/master/qcd_processor-v3.ipynb)
* [plotting.ipynb - scipy and matplotlib based fitting and plotting is done in this notebook](https://github.com/mandalaritra1/JERcoffeacasa/blob/master/plotting.ipynb)

Some helpful function and the main fitting class is in the `utils.py` file.
